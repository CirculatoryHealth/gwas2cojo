# CHANGES

This document tracks changes to the codebase. Each entry should include a brief description of the change, the files affected, and any relevant context or reasoning behind the change. This helps maintain a clear history of modifications and facilitates collaboration among developers.

## 2025-03-12 🛠️ Updates to GWAS list
- 🆕**Added**: New GWAS datasets to the `gwas_list.txt` file, including:
    - ISGC GigaStroke datasets for ALLSTROKE, IS, CES, LAS, and SVD subtypes.
    - CHARGE cIMT (Franceschini 2018) and CHARGE Plaque (Franceschini 2018) datasets.
- 🛠️**Updated**: The `gwas_list.txt` file to ensure consistency in formatting and correct file paths.
- 🛠️**Updated**: Changed the SLURM parameters for `gwaslab.process.array_for_submit.sh`. 

## 2025-03-12 🆕 New functions
- 🆕**Added**: A notebook to test drive some functions and option using `gwaslab`. 
    - New functionality to save QC-filtered output in `gwaslab.process.ipynb`.
    - Plots for QC-filtered dataset in `gwaslab.process.ipynb`.
    - Extraction of lead SNPs in `gwaslab.process.ipynb`.
- 🆕**Added**: New script to process a given GWAS using `gwaslab`. This script will:
    - Load the GWAS summary statistics.
    - Perform liftover if necessary.
    - Check reference alleles and flip if needed.
    - Check for duplicates and remove them.
    - Check for strand issues and resolve them.
    - Check for allele frequency issues and filter variants accordingly.
    - Perform QC filtering.
    - Generate plots for both the full dataset and the QC-filtered dataset.
    - Extract lead SNPs from the QC-filtered dataset.
    - Ensure the `stem` variable is defined for both normal and --only-qc paths, allowing consistent file naming across different branches of the code.
    - Updated plotting functions in `gwaslab.process.py` to include verbose logging and ensure that plots are saved with the correct DPI settings.
    - Handles the case where a pickle file was created and the --only-qc flag is used to regenerate plots without re-running the full pipeline.
- 🛠️**Updated**: The `LICENSE` file to correct the copyright year.
- 🛠️**Updated**: The `.gitignore` file to include new directories and files that should be ignored by git.
- 🛠️**Updated**: The `CHANGES.md` file to document the new functions and updates made to the codebase.
- 🛠️**Updated**: The `README.md` file to reflect the new functionality and provide instructions for using the new script and notebook.
- 🛠️**Updated**: The `gwaslab.process.py` file to include the new script for processing GWAS summary statistics and to ensure that the `stem` variable is defined in all relevant branches of the code.
- 🆕**Added**: Scripts for submitting GWAS processing jobs:
    - `gwaslab.process.submit.sh`: A shell script to submit a GWAS processing job to a cluster using `sbatch`.
    - `gwaslab.process.array_for_submit.sh`: A shell script to submit an array of GWAS processing jobs for multiple datasets or parameters. This is controlled by the `gwaslab.process.submit.sh` script, which can be configured to run multiple instances of the processing script with different arguments.
    - `gwas_list.txt`: A text file containing a list of GWAS datasets to be processed. This file is used by the `gwaslab.process.array_for_submit.sh` script to determine which datasets to process in the array job. Each line in the file should specify a GWAS dataset, and the processing script will read this file to know which datasets to run on.
